    <h1>Not as luxorious as they say! Here's my story...</h1>
    <p>IMT Dayton Station is not the place to move. They call themselves a luxury apartment complex, however, our move in inspection says otherwise. 

        We moved in during COVID-19, and it looked like the place hadn't even been stepped in after the previous residents left. There were 3 shelves missing from the fridge as well as a drawer and the ice machine did not work. All of our food was in a pile in the fridge for 12 days until they replaced it since there was literally no room. Even the maintenance guy when he opened it said "Yeah, you can't fit anything in here."
        
        They claim they had a cleaning crew come through, but neither tub was snaked, the sinks fill with water as you wash your hands, there were dead bugs on the windowsills as well as layers upon layers of dust and dead bugs on top of the kitchen cabinets. 
        
        On every single window frame there is a sticky substance. Eventually they sent a cleaner back out to handle this, however she was 5' and didn't have anything more than a 2-step step-stool, meaning she couldn't reach the dead bugs on the top of the cabinets and so she wouldn't clean them, and I had to. She cleaned off some windows but didn't clean off the ones in the bedrooms. Then she left. 
        
        There's a huge microwave panel missing, and so when you open the microwave while the vent is on you get hit in the face with air. As they replaced this today, I heard them say they were taking it to 104.
        
        There wasn't even a working light bulb in one of the bedrooms. 
        
        There is red substance on the blinds in the kitchen, not sure if it's blood or marinara sauce (hoping for the latter), the ac intake is absolutely gross, covered in dust and debris from the people before us. 
        
        The cabinets in the kitchen did not have all the shelves, the drawer in the private bath didn't all have handles. 
        
        There were cigarette and blunt butts on our patio upon move in.
        
        We weren't given a key to our storage unit. 
        
        There are dead bugs in the light fixtures.
        
        There are paint spots on the carpet, and nail polish (or something) on the floor in the living room.
        
        The did order us a new fridge and it is banged up and we were told by Ben we needed to clean it off with goo gone. What even?? It was delivered 6/4 and not usable until 6/5 since it had to cool, etc. 
        
        THIS IS NOT ALL. On our first night in the apartment, we noticed the window in the second bedroom was broken. We called emergency maintenance and a girl answered and told us she would put in an emergency order, took all of my info including asking all the standard questions, do you have an alarm? Do you have a dog? Can they enter? etc. An hour and a half alter we call back and find out she had been lying and actually there is a special number we have to call. From 10pm to 2:30am we emailed the community manager and called emergency maintenance, and WE NEVER GOT A RESPONSE. Their emergency maintenance does not actually exist. And a broken window is listed on the voicemail as an acceptable reason to call. The after-hours leasing office response to this was well we can put in an order and they can take care of it tomorrow? Unacceptable for a breach of security.
        
        Next, we moved in on a special for $600 off. In our lease it says is applies to June 2020 rent. They didn't apply it, tried to make us pay it or go get a money order during a pandemic, and finally let us wait until the credit was applied. This isn't a "we aren't doing the cleaning you have to" special, it was a move in special, so it does not excuse the state of the apartment. 
        
        We asked for compensation and they offered us $50. That is 3% of the rent, which is $1650. I told Angela, the community manager, that her offer was trash and she made excuses about how everything was cosmetic. She negotiated with someone and are giving my wife and I $100 off. When they sent over the paperwork, it included a clause that we could not talk about any of this. We passed on the $100 so we could post this. Ridiculous.
        
        This community is a bad excuse for a joke. They have not finished working on everything and it has been 19 days.</p>

    <h1>Don't move to IMT Dayton Station! Here's my story...</h1>
    <p>IMT Dayton Station, while it may look nice in photos, is not the place to move. They call themselves a luxury apartment complex,
        however, our move in inspection says otherwise.</p> 

    <p>It is important to note here that IMT Dayton Station could not fill out our move in paperwork correctly. We had an email chain between 
        me and the leasing agent Bailey going back and forth <em>numerous</em> times.</p>

    <p>We moved in during COVID-19, and it looked like the place hadn't even been stepped in after the previous residents left. There were
        3 shelves missing from the fridge as well as a drawer and the ice machine did not work. All of our food was in a pile in the fridge
        for 12 days until they replaced it since there was literally no room. Even Ben the maintenance guy when he opened it said "Yeah, you
        can't fit anything in here."</p>

    <p>Ben also commented multiple times that these things should have been taken care of during the flip. </p> 
    <p>They claim they had a cleaning crew come through, but neither tub was snaked, the sinks fill with water as you wash your hands, there 
        were dead bugs on the windowsills as well as layers upon layers of dust and dead bugs on top of the kitchen cabinets. This is interesting 
        to me, because Angela sent me an invoice showing the cleaning of the apartment and that it was less than $150 for a 2 bedroom 2 bath. They 
        are a large apartment complex, so maybe they get discounts, however my previous apartment complex paid $150 for a deep cleaning on my studio 
        at $150 and it was 400 square feet. This apartment is 1100 square feet and this is during a pandemic!</p>

    <p>On every single window frame there was a sticky substance. Eventually they sent a cleaner back out to handle this, however she was 5' 
        and didn't have anything more than a 2-step step-stool, meaning she couldn't reach the dead bugs on the top of the cabinets and so 
        she wouldn't clean them, and I had to. She cleaned off some windows but didn't clean off the ones in the bedrooms. Then she left. </p>

    <p>There was a huge microwave panel missing, and so when you open the microwave while the vent is on you get hit in the face with air. As 
        they replaced this on 6/11/2020, I heard them say they were taking it to 104, which is across the hall.</p> 

    <img src="/IMT Move-In Review Photos/IMG_6405.jpg" style="width:300px;">

    <p>The light bulb in my bedroom did not work. </p> 
    <p>There was red substance on the blinds in the kitchen, not sure if it was blood or marinara sauce (hoping for the latter), and the ac intake 
        is absolutely gross, covered in dust and debris from the people before us. </p>

    <img src="/IMT Move-In Review Photos/IMG_6428.jpg" style="width:300px;">

    <p>The cabinets in the kitchen did not have all the shelves, the drawer in the private bath didn't all have handles. </p> 

    <img src="/IMT Move-In Review Photos/IMG_6400.jpg" style="width:300px;">

    <p>There were cigarette and blunt butts on our patio upon move in. </p> 
    <p>We weren't given a key to our storage unit, and they never told us this. When I brought it up, they said oh yeah we didn't have the part. We 
        will order it and get it replaced. They did, eventually.</p> 
    <p>There are dead bugs in the light fixtures. This hasn't been fixed, and I am pretty sure they won't do it, seeing as I've told them multiple 
        times, they've been here at least five times as of 6/12/2020, when we moved in 5/24/2020.</p> 
    <p>There are paint spots on the carpet, and there was nail polish (or something) on the floor in the living room.</p>

    <p>The did order us a new fridge and when it was delivered by maintenance it wass banged up and we were told by Ben we needed to clean it 
        off with goo gone. What even?? It was delivered 6/4 and not usable until 6/5 since it had to cool, etc., so 12 days after move in until 
        having a proper fridge. And why would we have to clean that?! Luxury my ass. </p> 
    <p>THIS IS NOT ALL. On our first night in the apartment, we noticed the window in the second bedroom was broken. We called emergency 
        maintenance and a girl answered and told us she would put in an emergency order, took all of my info including asking all the standard 
        questions, do you have an alarm? Do you have a dog? Can they enter? etc. An hour and a half alter we call back and find out she had been 
        lying and actually there is a special number we have to call. From 10pm to 2:30am we emailed the community manager and called emergency 
        maintenance, and WE NEVER GOT A RESPONSE. Their emergency maintenance does not actually exist. And a broken window is listed on the 
        voicemail as an acceptable reason to call. The after-hours leasing office response to this was well we can put in an order and they 
        can take care of it tomorrow? Unacceptable for a breach of security. Other reviews question if they exist as well.</p> 
    <p>Next, we moved in on a special for $600 off. In our lease it says is applies to June 2020 rent. They didn't apply it, tried to make us 
        pay it or go get a money order during a pandemic, and finally let us wait until the credit was applied. This isn't a "we aren't doing 
        the cleaning, you have to" special, it was a move in special, so it <b>does not excuse the state of the apartment.</b></p> 
    <p>We asked for compensation and they offered us $50. That is 3% of the rent, which is $1650. I told Angela, the community manager, that 
        her offer was trash and she came back and started making excuses about how everything was cosmetic. This is not true. A broken window 
        is not cosmetic, and that's just the start. She negotiated with someone (idk who, she's the community manager) and are giving my wife 
        and I $100 off. When they sent over the paperwork, it included a clause that we could not talk about any of this. We passed on the $100
        so we could post this. Ridiculous.</p>

    <h4>How many people have they paid off to keep their 3.6 stars on google??</h4>

    <p>It is now 6/15/2020 and I just opened the drain on our second bathtub (used once to shower and pooled water) and this is what I found.</p>

    <h1><b>This community is a bad excuse for a joke. They finished working on everything 27 days after move in. This however does not take into 
        account the things we still find, like the fact they didn't clean under any appliances (washer, dryer, stove, etc.)! In fact today when I 
        ran the dishwasher (6/22/2020) the detergent door doesnt open during use. I am on the third time running it, trying to get it to open, PRAYING 
        to the universe I don't have to deal with management/maintenance again.</b></h1>
